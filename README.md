# Python SDK for BTC

Python BTC is an experimental project that aims to provide human-friendly interfaces for common BTC operations. Note that Python BTC is not a complete SDK, but only implements the BTC functions that I am interested in.

Features:

- No third-party dependencies. All code is visible.
- Incredibly simple.

## Installation

```sh
$ python -m pip install pybtc
```
